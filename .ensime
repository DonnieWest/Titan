;; This is a mock .ensime file created by the Ensime plugin.
;; It covers typical configuration entries necessary for an Ensime project.

;; Make sure that :source-roots contain only the folders that you need in your project,
;; and then fill in :compile-deps with a list of libraries your project depends on
;; (in .ensime lists are whitespace-separated, not comma-separated).

;; :target should point to the location that contains compiled classes for the project.
;; Ensime will use this location for completions and debugging.
;; However note that Ensime will not compile the project for you.
;; Use one of the established build tools (Ant, Maven, SBT, etc) to do that.

;; After that you can run Tools > Ensime > Maintenance > Startup
;; (this command, along with a few others, is also available via the command palette).

;; If your project contains a lot of files, it is advisable to enable (:disable-source-load-on-startup t).
;; Otherwise Ensime might incur a massive lag at startup time.
;; At some point this scenario will be documented, but for now please contact us directly.
;; For Scala development use .ensime.SAMPLE from https://github.com/scala/scala.
